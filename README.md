NameGame
========

When I started at Hacker School, I wanted to create a game that would help my classmates learn one anotherâ€™s names. This game generates 4 random people, as well as the names of these people - the goal of the game is to match the names to the pictures. A stats page has been created so that everyone can see the percentage of people that are guessing specific names correctly.

Ingredients include python, flask, postgres and jquery
